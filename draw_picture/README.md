- analyze_vc.py: draw the imortance measurement curve for single VC. Red curve is the probability drop when certain VC is missing, blue curve is the recogniton probability with only one certain VC. Then show examples for top,random and bottom VCs.
- combine_curve.py: combine the importance measurement curve for top 80 single,pair,triplet and quadruplet VCs.
- combine_score.py: the pair VC version of analyze_vc.py
-	draw_34vc.py: draw examples for most important triplet and quadruplet VCs.
- draw_share_curve.py: draw the relation ship between VC shared times (among different classes, calculated in class number) and its importance.
- general_analyze_vc.py: generalize the imortance measurement curve for single VC
- vc_share_withinclass.py: draw the relation ship between VC shared times (among different images in a certain class, calculated in images number) and its importance.
